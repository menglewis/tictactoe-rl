# Tic Tac Toe with Q Learning

This is a simple command line interface to training an agent to play Tic Tac Toe using Q Learning. When run, it creates 2 Q Learning Agents that continuously play against each other and learn for a specified number of iterations. After the iterations are complete, it will allow the user to play games of Tic Tac Toe against one of the agents.

The agent can be serialized to a JSON file by setting the filename and setting the save_learner parameter to True. The agent can also be loaded from the file by setting the filename and setting the load_learner parameter to True.
